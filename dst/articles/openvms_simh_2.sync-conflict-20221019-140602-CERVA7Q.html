<h1 id="OpenVMS%20and%20SIMH%20-%20Part%202">OpenVMS and SIMH - Part 2</h1>

<p>Running OpenVMS on the SIMH VAX simulator</p>

<p>Welcome to the second part of  <a href="OpenVMS_and_SIMH_pt1.html">Getting Started with OpenVMS and SIMH</a>. This article assumes that you have already followed  <a href="OpenVMS_and_SIMH_pt1.html">part 1</a>  or have at least installed  <strong>OpenVMS VAX 7.3</strong>  on a system, with  <strong>dua0</strong> containing the OS,  <strong>dua1</strong>  containing user-directories, and TCP&#47;IP services are functional. If in doubt, have a quick read over what we did in the first part. For this part, we will install and use  <strong>UNZIP</strong>,  <strong>wget</strong>,  <strong>Compaq C</strong> and the  <strong>WASD</strong>  HTTP server.  </p>

<p>Although I&#8217;d &#47;love&#47; to throw you in at the deep-end, I think the transition to OpenVMS will be easier if we introduce a couple of utilities you may be familiar with and break you in gently. This is a bit of a &#8216;ghetto&#8217; guide to OpenVMS 7.3, and is primarily for users learning through SIMH - so, we will use the easiest methods of retrieving and installing what we need (despite them not being the most traditional methods).  </p>

<p><strong>UNZIP &#38; WGET</strong>  </p>

<p>These two utilities, in my opinion, are extremely useful when getting started with OpenVMS 7.3 in SIMH. The main reason being that you will find many 3rd-party applications will be ZIP archived, and nowadays - HTTP is much more common for files than FTP. WGET, although slightly bloated, is one of the most popular utilities in the UNIX(-like) world for grabbing files over HTTP and FTP. Although you should be ashamed for bringing it and similar utilities into your nice, clean, OpenVMS installation - it will aid you in the transition from UNIX to OpenVMS by providing some niceties you have become accustomed to having. So, let&#8217;s grab &#8216;wget&#8217; first. Login to your OpenVMS system as a normal user, and type &#8216;<strong>sh def</strong>&#8217;. This is short for &#8216;<strong>SHOW DEFAULT</strong>&#8217; and is like the &#8216;<strong>pwd</strong>&#8217; command on UNIX&#47;Unix-like systems. It will display the current directory you are in. If you followed the first tutorial on installing OpenVMS in SIMH, you should see something like the following:  </p>

<pre><code>$ sh def
  DUA1:[INT16H]
</code></pre>

<p>This means that you are in a directory named &#8220;<strong>INT16H</strong>&#8221; at the root of the <strong>DUA1:</strong> drive. We will discover more about how directories are addressed in a moment.  </p>

<p>We should create a directory for our downloaded files to live in. Looking at the above &#8216;<strong>path</strong>&#8217;, how would you expect a full path to &#8216;<strong>DOWNLOADS</strong>&#8217; within the &#8216;<strong>INT16H</strong>&#8217; directory to look? On a Unix-like system, you would probably expect something like &#8216;<strong>&#47;home&#47;int16h&#47;downloads</strong>&#8217; - but this is not UNIX.  </p>

<p>For clarity, we will create a directory using its full path using the &#8216;<strong>create</strong>&#8217; command like when we created the user-directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ create&#47;dir dua1:[INT16H.DOWNLOADS]
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we first reference the device, then the path from there is [enclosed], with each directory separated by a period&#47;dot&#47;full-stop. This is probably more similar to AmigaDOS than any other modern operating systems you may have came across.  </p>

<p>You will receive no confirmation of the command&#8217;s success, but if it did not succeed - you will receive an error message. To see that your new directory does actually exist, run &#8216;<strong>dir</strong>&#8217; (<strong>DIRECTORY</strong>), which will provide you with a directory-listing, similar to that below.</p>

<pre><code>$ dir

Directory DUA1:[INT16H]

DOWNLOADS.DIR;1

Total of 1 file.    
</code></pre>

<p>We can now move into this directory by issuing the &#8220;<strong>set def</strong>&#8221; (<strong>SET DEFAULT</strong>) command. You could pass &#8216;<strong>dua1:[INT16H.DOWNLOADS]</strong>&#8217; as the path to change to, but as we are in the directory where our target directory exists - that wouldn&#8217;t be the quickest path. Instead, run &#8216;<strong>set def [.DOWNLOADS]</strong>&#8217; - the &#8216;.&#8217; before &#8216;<strong>DOWNLOADS</strong>&#8217; tells the system that we want to change to a directory named &#8216;<strong>DOWNLOADS</strong>&#8217; within the current directory. Although it may be tempting to issue &#8216;<strong>set def DOWNLOADS</strong>&#8217; or &#8216;<strong>set def [DOWNLOADS]</strong>&#8217; but this wouldn&#8217;t work how you may expect:</p>

<pre><code>$ set def [.DOWNLOADS]
$ sh def
  DUA1:[INT16H.DOWNLOADS]

$ set def dua1:[INT16H.DOWNLOADS]
$ sh def
  DUA1:[INT16H.DOWNLOADS]
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from either command above, we are now in the correct directory. If you were to change to &#8216;[DOWNLOADS]&#8217; instead of [.DOWNLOADS] we would receive:</p>

<pre><code>$ set def [DOWNLOADS]
$ sh def
  DUA1:[DOWNLOADS]
%DCL-I-INVDEF, DUA1:[DOWNLOADS] does not exist
</code></pre>

<p>This is because &#8216;<strong>[DOWNLOADS]</strong>&#8217; would take us to &#8216;<strong>DUA1:[DOWNLOADS]</strong>&#8217; which doesn&#8217;t currently exist.  </p>

<p>It would be quite useful if we knew how to go back a directory. In many operating systems, &#8216;<strong>cd ..</strong>&#8217; would allow you to do this, but as you know - we use &#8216;<strong>set def</strong> (&#8216;<strong>SET DEFAULT</strong>&#8217;), and rather than &#8216;<strong>..</strong>&#8217; we use &#8216;<strong>[-]</strong>&#8217;. So, we will move back into your &#8216;home&#8217; directory now:</p>

<pre><code>$ set def [-]
$ sh def
  DUA1:[INT16H]
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you know how to create directories and navigate around the data disk, we will create one more directory, naming it &#8220;BIN&#8221; - so store programs you want for your own use.</p>

<pre><code>$ create&#47;dir [.BIN]
</code></pre>

<p>Change directory to [.BIN] and we shall download the UNZIP utility.</p>

<pre><code>$ set def [.BIN]
</code></pre>

<p>Available for OpenVMS is a wide range of freeware utilities and applications, usually made available from the <del><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090312034329/http://www.openvms.compaq.com/openvms/freeware/">OpenVMS Freeware CDs</a></del>. These are available as large zip files from Compaq (HP) or alternatively, you can browse and download programs from the Freeware CDs as well as many others via <del><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090312034329/http://www.saic.com/">SAIC.com&#8217;s</a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090312034329/http://mvb.saic.com/">OpenVMS Freeware Archive</a>.</del> The problem is, many of them are zipped - and we do not have the means to unzip these archives.  </p>

<p>Luckily, many FTP sites contain useful tools such as UNZIP in a compiled executable for Alpha, ia64 and VAX; suitable for running straight away. Such sites include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090312034329/http://www.process.com/">Process.com</a> and the <del><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090312034329/http://mvb.saic.com/">SAIC OpenVMS Freeware Archive</a></del> mentioned above. We will be using SAIC&#8217;s archive so that you can get used to the structure of the Freeware CDs.  </p>

<p>You will see that we logged in as user <strong>Anonymous</strong> and we gave our ident (username) as the password. As you connect to more FTP servers running OpenVMS, you will notice that the &#8216;Anonymous&#8217; login will always require your ident - rather than an e-mail address like many other servers nowadays.  </p>

<p>The utilities we will be downloading are located in <strong>[.FREEWAREV80.000tools.vax_images]</strong>. Although the server has been set to use UNIX syntax by default (as we were informed by the MOTD), we can still navigate through the server like a normal OpenVMS system. Let&#8217;s go to the directory we require now.</p>

<p>If you have any problems retrieving directory listings, downloading files etc - you can adjust the PASV&#47;PASSIVE FTP settings with the &#8216;<strong>passive</strong>&#8217; command. Type &#8220;<strong>exit</strong>&#8221; to disconnect and terminate FTP. Using the &#8216;<strong>r</strong>&#8217; (&#8216;<strong>RUN</strong>&#8217;) command, we can check that the binaries&#47;images will run successfully:</p>

<pre><code>$ r unzip.exe
UnZip 5.52 of 28 February 2005, by Info-ZIP.  For more details see: unzip -v.
~
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect! Or is it? Let&#8217;s try to run unzip.exe again, but this time we&#8217;ll append &#8216;-v&#8217; to it.</p>

<pre><code>$ r unzip.exe -v
%DCL-W-MAXPARM, too many parameters - reenter command with fewer parameters
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s not very useful, not for running a command which requires parameters anyway. OpenVMS has an extremely useful online help system (online as in live, within the OS). Let&#8217;s have a brief look at that now and hope we can discover why we can&#8217;t use &#8216;<strong>RUN</strong>&#8217; how we would like:</p>

<pre><code>$ help run

RUN

     Executes an image within the context of your process (see Image).
     If you are invoking an image requiring one or more parameters,
     you must use the Automatic Foreign Command format or the Foreign
     Command format.

     Creates a subprocess or a detached process to run an image and
     deletes the process when the image completes execution (see
     Process).

  Additional information available:

  Image      Process

RUN Subtopic? 
</code></pre>

<p>We have established that &#8216;<strong>run</strong>&#8217; won&#8217;t let us use programs which require argc&#47;argv-style parameters, and now the help system has informed us that we must use the <strong>Automatic Foreign Command</strong> format or the <strong>Foreign Command</strong> format. Foreign Commands are usually programs which aren&#8217;t native to OpenVMS and as such don&#8217;t comply with how OpenVMS expects applications to be run - or can be any programs&#47;commands outside of DCL. For example the &#8216;<strong>RUN</strong>&#8217; command, if issued without a filename as a parameter, will prompt you to enter a filename. This is not the case with the vast majority of programs which have been ported from UNIX and other systems. To exit from the help system, press <strong>CTRL-Z</strong>.  </p>

<p>To be able to run these commands, we will define a <strong>symbol</strong>. A symbol is a symbolic name or alias for a string, the result isn&#8217;t unlike setting environment variables in other operating systems. <strong>==</strong> is used for global symbols, and prepended a colon (&#8216;:&#8217;) is used for strings. Here are a couple of examples of setting symbols:</p>

<pre><code>$ A == 1
$ B :== bee
</code></pre>

<p>The online help system can tell us the format used for setting symbols:</p>

<pre><code>     symbol-name =[=] expression

   symbol-name[bit-position,size] =[=] replacement-expression
</code></pre>

<p>Using the &#8216;<strong>SHOW</strong>&#8217; command, you can display the value of any single symbol or all of them at once:</p>

<pre><code>$ show symbol A
  A = 1   Hex = 00000001  Octal = 00000000001

$ show symbol&#47;all
  A = 1   Hex = 00000001  Octal = 00000000001
  B = "BEE"
</code></pre>

<p>These can be used like variables, aliases for commands etc. If we wanted to create a symbol called &#8216;<strong>ls</strong>&#8217; which had the string value &#8220;<strong>DIR</strong>&#8221; associated with it, we could use &#8216;<strong>ls</strong>&#8217; in place of &#8216;<strong>DIR</strong>&#8217;:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls :== DIR
$ sh symbol ls
  LS = "DIR"
$ ls

Directory DUA1:[INT16H.BIN]

UNZIP.EXE;1         ZIP.EXE;1           

Total of 2 files.
</code></pre>

<p>This is all very useful, but it doesn&#8217;t quite let us run our Foreign Commands yet. Try creating a symbol which will point to &#8216;<strong>DUA1:[INT16H.BIN]UNZIP.EXE</strong>&#8217;, then issue your new symbol as a command:</p>

<pre><code>$ unzip :== DUA1:[INT16H.BIN]UNZIP.EXE
$ unzip
%DCL-W-IVVERB, unrecognized command verb - check validity and spelling \DUA1\
</code></pre>

<p>We need to flag the symbol as being associated with a foreign command, so it will treat it as such. This is done by adding &#8216;$&#8217; at the beginning of the &#8216;path&#8217;:</p>

<pre><code>$ unzip :== $DUA1:[INT16H.BIN]UNZIP.EXE
$ sh symbol unzip
  UNZIP == "$DUA1:[INT16H.BIN]UNZIP.EXE"
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&#8217;s try running &#8216;unzip&#8217; again, and then try issuing the &#8216;-v&#8217; parameter.</p>

<pre><code>$ unzip

Compiled with VAX C for VMS (V5.4-2 VAX) on Feb 28 2005.
</code></pre>

<p>Congratulations, you can now unzip files. Usually you would put system utilities somewhere such as </p>

<pre><code>SYS$SYSTEM
</code></pre>

<p>this is a logical name which points to &#8216;<strong>SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSEXE]</strong>&#8217; which has another logical name ;). If you would like to see a list of defined logical names, you may run &#8216;<strong>show logical&#47;all</strong>&#8217;.  </p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s not ideal to create symbols for every Foreign Command program you wish to use, OpenVMS now has something comparable to the $PATH environment variable - &#8216;<strong>dcl$path</strong>&#8217;. This is defined with the &#8216;<strong>define</strong>&#8217; command, and will allow you to set one or more directories to be in your &#8220;path&#8221; for running Foreign Commands. To enable us to run any executables from our [.BIN] directory, we shall add it to &#8216;<strong>dcl$path</strong>&#8217; now:</p>

<pre><code>$ define dcl$path dua1:[INT16H.BIN]
</code></pre>

<p>You can check that it is working by running &#8220;zip&#8221; from the command-line.  </p>

<p>Finally we have acquired the ZIP and UNZIP utilities, but have also learned some basic but important OpenVMS commands. Next we will download &#8216;wget&#8217;, another utility from the UNIX world, and install it into our personal &#8216;BIN&#8217; directory.  </p>

<p><strong>Wget - the web-getter</strong> Wget for OpenVMS is available from <a href="http://www.antinode.info/dec/index.html">AntiNode.info</a> amongst other places, as are a few other utilities you may find useful. We will be downloading a ZIP file to our DOWNLOADS directory, extracting it, then copying the wget binary to BIN:</p>

<p>A supplemental disc is available for OpenVMS 7.3, this contains developer tools which can be essential if you want a fully-functional learning system. This will give us an opportunity to make use of our recently-installed &#8216;wget&#8217; utility. While still in [.DOWNLOADS], create a new directory called SUPP, change to this dir then use &#8216;wget&#8217; to retrieve your ZIP:</p>

<p>Ok, so you&#8217;ve waited for this archive to decompress - and now you are presented with 37 files. You will notice that most of the files end in a one-letter extension, the two exceptions being the .ZIP and .PCSI files. Lets delete the ZIP file to save space.</p>

<pre><code>$ delete DEC-VAXVMS-FORTRAN-V0606-201-1.PCSI;1
</code></pre>

<p>You should get used to using full filenames, including the revision appendage(;#) when working with files in OpenVMS. Back to our supplements! When you registered for your hobbyist PAKs, I hope you chose every one which was available as you will need licenses&#47;PAKs for C, PASCAL, FORTRAN and anything else you&#8217;d like to install. Check your e-mail and look for the PAK which begins with: &#8216;<strong>$ LICENSE REGISTER C -</strong>&#8217;. Paste it into your terminal, and load it:</p>

<pre><code>$ $ LICENSE REGISTER C &#47;ISSUER=OPENVMS_HOBBYIST &#47;AUTHORIZATION=DECUS-XXX-#########-#######
 &#47;PRODUCER=DEC &#47;UNITS=0 &#47;TERMINATION_DATE=##-XXX-#### &#47;ACTIVITY=CONSTANT=100
 &#47;CHECKSUM=#-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

$ license load C
%LICENSE-I-UNLOADED, DEC C has been unloaded
%LICENSE-I-LOADED, DEC C was successfully loaded with 0 units
</code></pre>

<p>We now have a license installed and loaded for C. Now we may install it safely, without complaints. When installing &#8216;system&#8217; software, it is often preferred it is done as the &#8216;<strong>SYSTEM</strong>&#8217; user. Issue &#8216;<strong>lo</strong>&#8217; to logout of the system, then re-login as SYSTEM:</p>

$ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL CC064 DUA1:[INT16H.SUPP]
        OpenVMS VAX Software Product Installation Procedure V7.3

It is 14-JAN-2009 at 00:52.

Enter a question mark (?) at any time for help.

* Are you satisfied with the backup of your system disk [YES]? 

The following products will be processed:

  CC V6.4
        Beginning installation of CC V6.4 at 00:52

%VMSINSTAL-I-RESTORE, Restoring product save set A ...

**WARNING!** If you downloaded these sets and you are not using an original CD&#47;ISO, it&#39;s likely they do not have the correct attributes set for VMSINSTAL to acknowledge them. You may receive messages like:

%BACKUP-F-NOTSAVESET, DUA1:[INT16H.SUPP]CC064.A;1 is not a BACKUP save set
%VMSINSTAL-E-NOSAVESET, Save set  A  cannot be restored.

This may sound quite serious, but usually - as mentioned above, it&#39;s due to incorrect file attributes. This can be fixed quite easily:

$ SET FILE&#47;ATT=(LRL:32256,MRS:32256,RFM:FIX) CC064.*;*
$ @SYS$UPDATE:VMSINSTAL CC064 DUA1:[INT16H.SUPP]

Installation should now continue, most of the answers to questions will be quite easy to answer; If in doubt - answer &#39;YES&#39; to any questions regarding installing something.

        Product:      C
        Producer:     DEC
        Version:      6.4
        Release Date: 05-JAN-2001

* Does this product have an authorization key registered and loaded? YES

As we have already installed and loaded our PAK, you should answer &#39;YES&#39; here.

    The file SYS$STARTUP:CCXX$STARTUP.COM contains commands to be
    executed at system startup to allow for the best compilation
    performance.  You may want to invoke this command file from your
    system&#39;s site specific start up file.  This command file does not
    have to be invoked for correct operation of Compaq C.
</code></pre>

<p>Again, these kind of installation notes can be very useful. In this case it&#8217;s not crucial to perform this task for the product to function, but sometimes there will be additional steps you must take.  </p>

<h2 id="Installing%20WASD%20VMS%20Hypertext%20Services">Installing WASD VMS Hypertext Services</h2>

<p><a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/">WASD</a> is <strong>the</strong> HTTP server package exclusive to OpenVMS. We&#8217;re going to compile and install it now so you can test out the compiler you just installed. There are architecture-specific packages we could use to install WASD, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re eager to let it compile while you go make some coffee. We&#8217;ll start by downloading <strong>htroot930.zip</strong> from <a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/">wasd.vsm.com.au&#47;wasd&#47;</a>; make sure you are in your <strong>DOWNLOADS</strong>directory. After the transfer has completed, logout and then login as the SYSTEM user.</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http:&#47;&#47;wasd.vsm.com.au&#47;wasd&#47;htroot930.zip
$ lo
</code></pre>

<p>Because we have not covered the <strong>LOGIN.COM</strong> file yet, added our dcl$path to it and have not installed our utilities in [BIN] to a system-wide directory&#8230; we will have to manually set dcl$path. After this, we will change to the root of <strong>dua1</strong> using <strong>DUA1:[000000]</strong> as the path, and will finally unzip WASD there, and begin the installation.</p>

<pre><code>$ SET DEF dua1:[000000]
$ UNZIP dua1:[INT16H.DOWNLOADS]HTROOT930.ZIP
</code></pre>

<p>Extraction will take some time, it will result in the directory <strong>dua1:[HT_ROOT]</strong> being created. As per the WASD <a href="http://wasd.vsm.com.au/wasd/htroot930.txt">ReadMe</a> file - we may now proceed to install WASD.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> install one of the listed SSL toolkits, but we don&#8217;t really need SSL encryption for our little test (emulated) box at the moment. As previously mentioned, this will take some time - so find something constructive to do while you wait. I suggest looking for VAX or Alpha hardware on an auction site ;-).  </p>

<p>Eventually the build will finish. We have some more steps to do though:</p>

The &#39;server&#39; account HTTP$SERVER is the one the HTTPd process executes as.
It is considered a security advantage to script using a different account.

It must have a unique UIC, preferably in a group of it&#39;s own.
DO NOT choose the SYSTEM group ([1,*]) or other privileged group, or [3nn,*]
which is reserved to OpenVMS!

Note: [077,1] is a suggested UIC.
You will be shown whether the entered uic exists before continuing.
Entering "NONE" OR "0" skips account creation&#47;modification.

[077,1]: 077,1

If no user matched the specification then the UIC is available!
Choices: YES, create the account using this UIC.  NO, select another.

[NO]: YES
</code></pre>

<p>The server account &#8220;HTTP$SERVER&#8221; must have a unique home directory.</p>

<p>The default is a reasonable location for most sites.</p>

<p>If another device is preferred or already in place, out of the package tree,
then that can be specified and used.  The directory name should remain as
[HTTP$SERVER] however.  Package security settings are applied to this.</p>

<p>You will be shown whether the home area already exists before continuing.
Entering &#8220;NONE&#8221; OR &#8220;0&#8221; exits this dialog.</p>

If you have other accounts that script using files contained in the general
scripting areas ([CGI-BIN], [AXP-BIN], [IA64-BIN] or [VAX-BIN]) you almost
certainly will need to grant the WASD_HTTP_NOBODY rights identifer to allow
those accounts access to the files in the scripting directories.

If you use a scripting account (HTTP$NOBODY) separate to the server account
(HTTP$SERVER) you should never, and should never need to, grant the
WASD_HTTP_NOBODY identifier to the server account.  The idea is to isolate the
two environments as much as possible.

    QUERY and EXTRACT are scripts that can be used to perform ad hoc searching of
    HTML and plain-text documents and files, returning all or partial documents.
    The scope of where they can search should be carefully controlled but they can
    be very useful.  Check script source descriptive prologue for more detail.

<p>Excellent. Not only is WASD HTTPd running, it&#8217;s running as the user it should be - <strong>HTTP$SERVER</strong>. Try opening a browser and accessing your new server. Many of the demo scripts+functions won&#8217;t work for security reasons - you will be able to enable what you like later on when you configure and customize your server. For now, you can run &#8216;<strong>DEMO.COM</strong>&#8217; from &#8216;<strong>DUA1:[HT_ROOT.INSTALL]</strong>&#8217; which will start a demonstration server up on port 7080 in &#8220;promiscuous&#8221; mode. This should allow you to test the examples included with WASD. Be warned though, some scripts will cause the demo instance to die due the &#8216;SYSTEM&#8217; account&#8217;s <strong>AST quota</strong>. Quotas and the UAF will be explained later.</p>
