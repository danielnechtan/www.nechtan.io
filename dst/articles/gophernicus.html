<h1>Down the Gopher hole with OpenBSD, Gophernicus, and TLS</h1>

<p><strong>UPDATE: I've added TLS support to Gophernicus so you don't need to use stunnel anymore. The code is ugly and unpolished though so I wouldn't recommend for production use.</strong> </p>

<p>In the early 2000s I thought I had seen the worst of the web - Java applets, Macromedia (>Adobe) Flash, animated GIFs, javascript snow that kept you warm in the winter by burning out your CPU, and so on.  For a time we learned from these mistakes, and started putting the burden on the server-side - then with improvements in javascript engines we started abusing it again with JSON/AJAX and it all went down hill from there.</p>

<p>Like cloud computing, blockchains, machine learning and a tonne of other a la mode technologies around today - most users and service providers don't need websites that consume 1GB of memory processing JS and downloading 50MB of compressed data just to read Alice's one-page travel blog or Bob's notes on porting NetBSD to his blood-pressure monitor.</p>

<p>Before the HTTP web we relied on Prestel/Minitel style systems, BBS systems, and arguably the most accessible of all - Gopher! Gopher was similar to the locally accessed AmigaGuide format, in that it allowed users to search and retrieve documents interactively, with links and cross-references. Its efficiency and distraction-free nature make it attractive to those who are tired of the invasive, clickbait, ad-filled, javascript-laden web2/3.x. But enough complaining and evangelism - here's how to get your own Gopher Hole!</p>

<p>Gophernicus is a modern gopher daemon which aims to be secure (although it still uses inetd -_-); it's even in OpenBSD ports so at least we can rely on it to be reasonably audited. Let's install that and also an ncurses-based gopher client (or lynx(1)) to test things out later:</p>

<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add gophernicus gopher
</code></pre>

<p>If you plan on offering Gopher over TLS:</p>

<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add stunnel
</code></pre>

<p>Instruct inetd(8) how to handle gopher connections (defaults to port 70 TCP) by adding this to /etc/inetd.conf</p>

<pre><code>gopher stream tcp nowait _gophernicus /usr/local/libexec/in.gophernicus in.gophernicus -h go.cryogenix.net
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Replace go.cryogenix.net with your FQDN. </li>
<li>Add <strong>-T 343</strong> if you plan on using TLS on port 343 (IANA has no port allocated for Gopher over TLS but 343 is unassigned and I came across a post with someone mentioning it as a possibility).</li>
</ul>

<p>See <strong>/usr/local/share/doc/gophernicus/README</strong> for a full listing of command-line arguments and usage options; Gophernicus is feature-rich so it's recommended you RTFM carefully.</p>

<p>If you are using TLS, add a [gophernicus] service to /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf. For the cert and key, I just added an alternative name for my domain in /etc/acme-client.conf, moved the old cert and ran <strong>acme-client -vFAD cryogenix.net</strong> to update my Let's Encrypt cert:</p>

<pre><code>[gophernicus]
cert = /etc/ssl/cryogenix.net.crt
key = /etc/ssl/private/cryogenix.net.key
accept = 343
connect = 127.0.0.1:70
protocol = proxy
</code></pre>

<p>Create a directory for our virtual host's gopher hole and copy the default 'index' to it so we can test it:</p>

<pre><code>$ doas mkdir /var/gopher/go.cryogenix.net
$ doas cp /var/gopher/gophermap /var/gopher/go.cryogenix.net/
</code></pre>

<p>Enable and start inetd (and optionally stunnel):</p>

<pre><code>$ rcctl enable inetd
$ rcctl start inetd

$ rcctl enable stunnel
$ rcctl start stunnel
</code></pre>

<p>If you had no errors, you should now be able to use gopher(1) to connect to your server - either by hostname [and optional port] or gopher:// url.</p>

<pre><code>$ gopher gopher://go.cryogenix.net
</code></pre>

<p>If you used stunnel(1) to TLSify Gophernicus, one way you can connect with gopher(1) over TLS on port 343 is by using stunnel(1) on the client or socat(1):</p>

<pre><code>$ pkg_add stunnel
</code></pre>

<p>Add the following to /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf:</p>

<pre><code>[gophers]
client = yes
accept = 127.0.0.1:10343
connect = &lt;hostname&gt;:343
CApath = /etc/ssl/cert.pem
</code></pre>

<p>Then start stunnel with rcctl and connect gopher to 127.0.0.1:10343.</p>

<p>Alternatively, with socat:</p>

<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add socat
$ socat TCP4-LISTEN:10070 openssl-connect:go.cryogenix.net:343,cafile=/etc/ssl/cert.pem,method=TLS1.2,verify=0,reuseaddr &amp;
$ gopher gopher://localhost:10070
</code></pre>

<h5>Caveats</h5>

<ul>
<li>when connecting to stunnel, libressl returns error 21 (unable to verify first cert) - however the same cert returns no error on port 443 (httpd(8)).</li>
<li>socat(1) will die when the connection is closed or reaches EOF, which is on every gopher request. Normally we would add the 'fork' option to the end of the openssl-connect command but for some reason it causes gopher(1) to become a runaway process and eat up CPU time.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need a starting point with Gopher, SDF-EU's wiki has a good article <a href="https://sdfeu.org/w/tutorials:gopher">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, if you don't like gopher(1) - there's always lynx(1) or <a href="https://cryogenix.net/NCSA_Mosaic_OpenBSD.html">NCSA Mosaic</a>!</p>
