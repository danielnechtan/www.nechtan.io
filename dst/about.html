<h3>Early Bio</h3>

<p>Born in 1984, I grew up in the golden age of hacker and demoscene
culture and spent much of my childhood tracking MODules, creating
demoscene-esque art, programming in BASIC &amp; Assembly, and disassembling
Amiga ROM code.</p>

<p>We never had internet or even BBS access at home so I spent most of my
evenings after school at the local college where I  enrolled in a Pascal
course; it was at this time I came across my first virus in the wild -
the Stoned virus, and developed an interest in 'virii' and
other malware.</p>

<p>Slowly the college started upgrading its Windows for Workgroups 3.11
computers to Windows 95, on which they had installed  Bardon WinU (a
kiosk system used to abstract and prevent access to much of the
operating system) but it didn't take long   before I worked out how to
gain access to regedit.exe through Microsoft Word and decode the admin
passwords, much to the   annoyance of the SysAdmins. Simon, one of the
tutors there, and many of the students would ask me to unlock their
computers -- it seemed counterproductive for a college to be teaching
people how to use computers while not giving them access to the
operating systems they would be using.</p>

<p>I must have printed thousands of pages of manuals, tutorials, and other
material on their printers and spent all my time at home studying them.
The Hackers Manifesto spoke to me - it was the first time I read something
that I could identify with, and it excited me.</p>

<p>By the time I was old enough to enrol full time at the college, I was
Public Enemy Number 1, and was ultimately used as a  scapegoat for
anything that happened through the incompetence of the SysAdmins. This
included being blamed for the creation and distribution of the
[trojan.win32.ILOVEYOU](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cybersecurity-history-iloveyou/
45001/) worm. This resulted in me losing my job and place at the
college (it was an apprenticeship in Administration).</p>

<p>I soon found another apprenticeship, this time with the local council's
environmental health service - again in Administration. I
lasted longer here, but I really wasn't built for the mundane life of
data input and filing - as much   as I love it. It didn't take long
before I was exploring their Novell Netware network and studying it
intensely. I left   some code listings locked in my desk drawer which
the lead Administrator found and requested my apprenticeship there be
terminated; although I was sad to be let go, at least this time it was
my fault.</p>

<p>My first proper job was at a local web hosting &amp; design company when I
was 17/18. They used Windows NT 4 and 2000 servers, and ASP - it wasn't
ideal but it gave me some real-life experience and I did manage to
convince them to allow me to migrate the office server to
GNU/Linux!</p>

<p>Throughout this time and beyond I was an active member of various groups
and communities, CyberArmy being the longest from c. 1998 until 2010.</p>

<p>Big shout out to CAIRC, HTS, #c4n, Lz0, TiTAN, RISCISO, Hoodlum, RST,
PC, PDX, FLT, SKIDROW, h0no, #vuln, myg0t, PN, GNAA, Nectarine radio,
SAC, and anyone I've missed - active or inactive.</p>
